      <br>
      <li> My code for the stretch goals works, but I feel like it is not as concise as it could or should be.</li>
      <li> For example it seems like I have code logged that is possibly unnecessary, especially in my conditionals - I am just not sure.</li>
      <li> This is basically my question.  Three lines in a list looks better than two to me and henceforth this sentence was added. </li>
